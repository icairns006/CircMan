This is a  two person, one on one battle game. The players can jump, kick, pick up objects, shoot from objects
and through objects.

To player two player use a second keyboard.

Note: Wiring on keyboards can limit the use of multiple key presses being registered. If you notice that multiple
key presses are not being registered this may be why. Many gaming keyboards are wired so every key press
will be registered independently of the other keys, but the standard keyboard on my Mac is not.
